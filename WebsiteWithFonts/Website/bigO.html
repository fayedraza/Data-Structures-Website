<h3>Finding the Big O</h3>

<p class="text">
  Simplfying Big O Rules

  <p class="text">1. We will get rid of constants such as numbers like 1,2, or etc, so 3n would turn to n.
  </p>
  <p class="text">2. We will get rid of less dominant terms such as, if there was n^2 + n, we would get rid of n since it is less dominant.
    Also in cases like n + 3 it will be O(n) since 3 is just O(1) and it is less dominant than O(n). </p>
</p>

<p class = "text"> In this example we got a runtime like 2n+1 and now we want to simplfy it into Big O. First we will get rid of the less 
 dominant terms.
 <br>
 O(2n <strike> + 1 </strike>)
<br>
1 gets dropped since non dominant terms get dropped
<br>
O(<strike>2</strike>n)
<br>
2 gets dropped since constants get dropped
<br>
<b>Answer: O(n)</b>

 <h3>Big O Runtimes</h3>


 <h4>O(1) Runtime</h4>


 <p class="text">The O(1) runtime is always constant. No matter what the input it, the algorithm/method will always run in the same amount of time.</p>

 <p class="text"> <b>Examples of Java statements with O(1) runtime</b> 
  <br>
  <li class="text"> int x = 7; </li>
  <li class="text"> int b = 27*89;</li>
  <li class="text"> String s = "hi";</li>
  <li class="text"> System.out.println(a[0]); </li>
<br>
</p>

<p class="text">
  <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(1) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
<br>
                     READ number
<br>
                   DISPLAY number * 3
<br>
</p>

<p class="text">
  <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(1) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
<br>
                     READ number
<br>
                   DISPLAY number * 3
<br>
</p>
<p class="text">
  Despite the value of the number, it will always print that number multiplied by three meaning the time is consant which is why the runtime is O(1).
</p>

<p class="text">
  <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(1) runtimne (Java)</b>

" width="800" height="340">

<h4>O(n) Runtime</h4>


<p class="text">The O(n) runtime describes an algortihm that increases linearly. The program depends on the size of n.</p>

<p class="text">
  <b>Classic examples of O(n) runtime</b>

  <li class="text">Tranversing Through an Array</li>
  <li class="text">Tranversing Through a Link List</li>
  <li class="text">In Order Traversal</li>
  <li class="text">Heapify</li>
</p>
<p class="text">
  <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(n) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
<br>
         FOR each element in that array
<br>
              DISPLAY that element  
<br>
        ENDFOR
<br>
</p>

<p class="text">Since it will go through every element, so it depends upon how long the array is. If the 
  length of an array is one, it will take quickly to go through the array. However, 
  if the length is 1000, it will take a lot longer. In addition, it increases linearly 
  as the length of an array increases by 1 its time increases by a bit too.</p>

<h4>O(n^2) Runtime</h4>

<p class="text">
  The O(n^2) runtime describes an algorithm that runs in quadratic
   time. For instance, an algorithm that has an input of 10 runs 100 times.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    <b>Classic examples of O(n^2) runtime</b>

    <li class="text">Insertion Sort</li>
    <li class="text">Selection Sort</li>
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(n^2) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
  <br>
       For each row
  <br>
        For each element in that row 
  <br>
         DISPLAY that element
  <br>
      ENDFOR
  <br>
        ENDFOR
  <br>
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    <i>Note: Array is n by n</i>

This is an example of a nested for loop. Since it is going through every elment for 
each row, its run time is O(n^2). If the array length is three rows with three elements 
in each row then it will run nine times because 3^2 is 9.

  " width="800" height="340">

  <h4>O(log n) Runtime</h4>

<p class="text">
 
The O(log n) runtime describes an algorithm that runs log n times. Just remember that in computer science when we talk about 
log n the base is always 2. If an input is 16 then it will run 4 times.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    <b>Classic examples of O(log n) runtime</b>
  
    <li class="text">Binary Search</li>
    <li class="text"> AVL Tree</li>
  </p>

  <p class="text">This is a binary tree. Starting at the top which is 2 and as we choose to go left or right, we are eliminating the other half.
     For instace, if we choose to pick 7 instead of 5 then we will omit 5, 9, and 4.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    Look at the number of times the while loop ran.
    It is dividing by 2 every time it is passed into the while loop meaning that it will run log n times assuming that n is x.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(log n) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
  <br>
        READ x
  <br>
        WHILE x is greater than 0
  <br>
           SET x as x divided by 2
  <br>
       ENDWHILE
  </p>

  <p class = "text"> Example of an algorithm that has O(log n) runtimne (Java). The reason is when we take one path we 
    never go to the other path. And so on. On the image on the right, we end up touching 27, 40, and 30. We touched
    three nodes out of seven nodes. Log base 2 of 7 is similar to 3 which is the reason why the big o of searching on an
    AVL Tree is O(logn)

      <p class="text">
        On another note, I want to talk about that an O(n) algorithm is porportional to its input. Meaning lets say if an input array is a 2D
        Array and it runs O(n^2) but since they are proportional to each other, the Big O is O(n). We had an input of O(n) and it runs O(n^2)
        the Big O is O(n^2) as the input is porportional to it squared. This is the same for other Big O like O(log n) where the input is porportional
        to its logarithm of that input.
       </p>

    <h2>More Information About Big O</h2>

    <p class="text">
      1. Sometimes there can be more than one input that affects the runtime so the runtime can be like O(a + log b). In this case, a is the length of one array while b is the length of the other array. 
      Both for loops do not affect each other so the runtime is O(a+b). Another example is finding the sum of a 2D array where one input is the number of rows and the other input is the length of 
      each row (assuming that a and b does not have the same value). In this case, the Big O is O(ab).
    </p>

" width="820" height="340">

<p class="text">
  2. The Big O runtime O(n^2) can also have different exponents, such as O(n^3) which is slower than O(n^2) runtime. The higher the exponent the slower the runtime. An example is a triple nested for loop.
</p>

  3. The Big O runtime O(2^n) can also have a different base, such as 3^n which is slower than 2^n. The higher the base the slower the runtime.

<p class="text"><b>Example 1: int x= 7;</b></p>

<p class="text"><b>Example 3: An Array of Integers</b></p> 

<p class="text">The space complexity is O(n) becuase we are talking about an integer array that holds many integers. 
Each integer is 4 bytes so the space complexity of an array is O(4n) which is O(n). </p>

<p class="text"><b>Example 4: Linked Lists </b></p>

<p class="text">The space complexity is O(n) becuase we are talking about a list that holds many nodes.

<p class="text">
  The space complexity is O(n) becuase we are talking about an integer array that holds many integers 
  and two integer variables. Each variable space complexity is O(4). The array space complexity is O(4n) 
  since it is holding a number of integer values. With the space complexity of the method as O(4n + 4 + 4) 
  the 4s get dropped and the constant, 4, also gets dropped which makes the Big O, O(n).
