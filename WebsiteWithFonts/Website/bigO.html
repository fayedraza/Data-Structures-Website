    Q: How would you choose the best way?
    <br>
    <br>
    A: The one that is the fastest.

   <p class="text">
    Q: How to measure the efficiency of these algorithms? 
    <br>
    <br>
    A: Measure the space complexity and the time complexity of the algorithm. These two complexities will be explained later.

   <p class="text">
    Q: What is time complexity?
    <br>
    <br>
    A: The execution time of the algorithm that is denoted by the letter O (Big O).

<h3>Finding the Big O</h3>

<p class="text">
  Simplfying Big O Rules

  <p class="text">1. We will get rid of constants such as numbers like 1, 2, or etc, so 3n would turn to n.
  </p>
  <p class="text">2. We will get rid of less dominant terms such as, if there was n^2 + n, we would get rid of n since it is less dominant.
    Also in cases like n + 3 it will be O(n) since 3 is just O(1) and it is less dominant than O(n). </p>
</p>

<p class = "text"> In this example, we got a runtime like 2n+1 and now we want to simplify it into Big O. First, we will get rid of the less dominant terms.
 <br>
 O(2n <strike> + 1 </strike>)
<br>
1 gets dropped since non dominant terms get dropped
<br>
O(<strike>2</strike>n)
<br>
2 gets dropped since constants get dropped
<br>
<b>Answer: O(n)</b>

<p class = "text"> In this example we got a runtime like n^2+n+1 and now we want to simplfy it into Big O. First we will get rid of the less

 <h3>Big O Runtimes</h3>

<br>

 <h4>O(1) Runtime</h4>

<br>

<div class="specialText">
       
  <b>Examples of Java statements with O(1) runtime</b>

 <div class="listContainer">
  <li> int x = 7;  </li>
  <li> int b = 27*89;</li>
  <li>String s = "hi";</li>
  <li>System.out.println(a[0])</li>

<br>
                   DISPLAY number * 3
<br>
</p>

<p class="text">
  Despite the value of the number, it will always print that number multiplied by three meaning the time is constant which is why the runtime is O(1).
</p>

" width="800" height="340">

<h4>O(n) Runtime</h4>


<p class="text">The O(n) runtime describes an algortihm that is porportional to its linear runtime.</p>

<div class="specialText">
       
  <b>Classic examples of O(n) runtime</b>

 <div class="listContainer">
  <li> Tranversing through an array  </li>
  <li> Inserting to an arraylist (worst case)</li>
  <li> In order traversal</li>
</div>

</div>

<p class="text">
  <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(n) runtime (Pesudocode)</b>
<br>
         FOR each element in that array
<br>
              DISPLAY that element  
<br>
        ENDFOR
<br>
</p>

<p class="text">Since it will go through every element, so it depends upon how long the array is. If the 
  length of an array is one, it will take quickly to go through the array. However, 
  if the length is 1000, it will take a lot longer. In addition, it increases linearly 
  as the length of an array increases by 1 its time increases by a bit too.</p>

" width="800" height="340">

<h4>O(n^2) Runtime</h4>


<p class="text">
  The O(n^2) runtime describes an algorithm that is porportional to its quadratic input of its size. For instance, an algorithm that has an input of 10 runs 100 times.
  </p>

  <div class="specialText">

    This is an example of a nested for loop. Since it is going through every element for each row, its run time is O (n^2). 
    If the array length is three rows with three elements in each row then it will run nine times because 3^2 is 9.

  " width="800" height="340">

  <h4>O(log n) Runtime</h4>

<p class="text">
 
The O(log n) runtime describes an algorithm that is proportional to its logarithm of that input. Just remember that in computer science when we talk about 
log n the base is always 2. If an input is 16 then it will run 4 times.
  </p>

  <div class="specialText">
       
    <b>Classic examples of O(log n) runtime</b>
  
   <div class="listContainer">
    <li> Binary Search </li>
    <li> AVL Tree</li>

  <p class="text">
    <b>Example of an algorithm that has O(log n) runtimne (Pesudocode)</b>
  <br>
        READ x
  <br>
        WHILE x is greater than 0
  <br>
           SET x as x divided by 2
  <br>
       ENDWHILE
  </p>

  <p class = "text"> This is a binary tree. Starting at the top which is 27 and as we choose to go left or right, we are eliminating the other half.
     For instance, if we choose to pick 40 instead of 14 then we will omit 14, 7, and 20. Then we go to 30 we omit 50. Now we have reached to the 
     end of the tree and  we hit 3 values. The floor of log base 2 of 7 is 3 hence this is why the Big O is O(log n).

      <p class = "text"> Example of an algorithm that has O(n!) runtime in Java. On the image on the right, if the input is 3 then for each element in the first loop of length 3
        we traverse each element in length 2 and the traverse the final loop of length 1. So 3*2*1 = 6 which matches 3!.

      <p class="text">
        On another note, I want to talk about that an O(n) algorithm is proportional to its input. Meaning, lets say if an input array is a 2D Array and it runs O(n^2) but since they are 
        proportional to each other, the Big O is O(n).

    <h2>More Information About Big O</h2>

    <p class="text">
      1. Sometimes there can be more than one input that affects the runtime, so the runtime can be like O(a + log b). In this case, a is the length of one array while b is the length of the other array. 
      Both for loops do not affect each other so the runtime is O(a+b). Another example is finding the sum of a 2D rectangular array where one input is the number of rows and the other input is the length of 
      each row (assuming that a and b does not have the same value). In this case, the Big O is O(ab).

<p class="text">
  2. The Big O runtime O(n^2) can also have different exponents, such as O(n^3) which is slower than O(n^2) runtime. The higher the exponent the slower the runtime. An example is a triple nested for loop.

<p class="text"><b>Example 3: An Array of Integers</b></p> 

<p class="text">The space complexity is O(n) because we are talking about an integer array that holds many integers. 
Each integer is 4 bytes, so the space complexity of an array is O(4n) which is O(n). </p>

<p class="text"><b>Example 4: Linked Lists </b></p>

<p class="text">The space complexity is O(n) because we are talking about a list that holds many nodes. 
n represents a node which means it is O(n).</p>

<p class="text">
  The space complexity of the method below is O(n) because we are talking about an integer array that holds many integers 
  and two integer variables. Each variable space complexity is O(4). The array space complexity is 4n
  since it is holding a number of integer values. With the space complexity of the method as O(4n + 4 + 4) 
  the 4s get dropped and the constant, 4, also gets dropped which makes the Big O: O(n).
