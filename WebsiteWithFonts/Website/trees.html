         <h3>Deleting a Value in the Tree</h3>


         <p class = "text">While searching for the node to delete is part of the method, the deletion part might be a bit tricky. 
          <br> There are three cases we have to deal with in deletion whic are: no children, 1 child, two children. </p>

          <p class = "text"> In the first case, the node we want to delete has no children. It is easy as we can use the two pointer method 
            <br> and use the previous pointer and set the child to null. The Java implementation is located on the right.
            <br> Assume the node has already been found and the prev is the parent of that node.
          </p>

          <div class="flex-container">

          </div>

          <p class = "text"> In the second case, the node we want to delete has 1 child. It has a bit more steps but it should still be doable. 
            <br> We can use the previous pointer and connect it to the child of the node we are about to delete. The Java implementation is located on the right.
            <br> Assume the node has already been found and the prev is the parent of that node.
          </p>

          <p class = "text"> In the third case, the node we want to delete has 2 children. It can a bit difficult at first but we use in order predecessor 
            <br> find the node we want to switch with and delete. Basically, starting from the node we want to delete, we go left and then keep on going right till
            <br> we found a node whose right is null. The Java implementation is located below. Assume the node has already been found and the prev is the parent of that node.

           <p class = "text">This is how we can determine the height of the tree.</p>

           <p class = "solutions"> We can use a minHeap and for each element we add it into the heap. We check if the size of the heap
              is greater than k. If it is is then we pop one out as we know that it can not be the kth largest. At the end the parent 
              of the final heap is kth largest.

            case is O(n) as we will go through a skewed tree. Going down a skewed tree is just going through a linked list.
